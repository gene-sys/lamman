Percentage Allocation Management Module (PAMM) Accounts

PAMM accounts allow investors to allocate a percentage of their trading capital to copy trades from a master account. PAMM is different from other types of managed accounts, as PAMM investors can follow different trader accounts and diversify their trading capital by allocating different percentages to different trading systems. PAMM accounts offer more flexibility for the investor to choose multiple trading systems and hedge against any performance issues that may arise out of losses from specific master trading accounts.

Lot Allocation Management Module (LAMM) Accounts

In LAMM accounts, the investor chooses the amount of lots that can be traded in the market, and the profits or losses are determined according to the multiples of lots invested in the market. LAMM is a more basic iteration of the PAMM account that aims to lower the risk of trading and is usually suited for larger accounts that have a higher trading capital. LAMM accounts are typically used when percentage allocation loses significance due to the higher trading capital, as a higher trading capital will have significant issues while filling orders at the interbank exchanges.
